## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API not configured" error**
   - Check that your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
   - Restart the backend server after adding API keys

2. **Background removal fails**
   - Ensure Remove.bg API key is valid
   - Check your monthly quota (free tier: 50 images)
   - Verify image format (JPEG, PNG supported)

3. **Style transfer takes too long**
   - This is normal for AI processing
   - Check your Replicate API quota
   - Try with smaller images for faster processing

4. **Layout suggestions not working**
   - Ensure you have at least 2 images on the wall
   - Check that images are properly loaded

### Debug Mode

To see detailed error messages, check the backend console logs:

```bash
# In backend/server directory
npm run dev
```

Look for error messages in the console output.

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Background Removal
- Use high-contrast images for best results
- Avoid complex backgrounds
- Images with clear subject separation work best

### Style Transfer
- Start with clear, well-lit images
- Different styles work better with different image types
- Vintage style works well with portraits
- Modern style is great for landscapes

### Layout Suggestions
- Use images with similar aspect ratios for grid layouts
- Mix different image sizes for more dynamic layouts
- Consider the wall background when choosing layouts

## üîí Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API keys secure
- Monitor your API usage to avoid unexpected charges
- Consider using environment variables in production
